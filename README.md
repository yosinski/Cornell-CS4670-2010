This repository contains code for a class project by [Jason
Yosinski](http://yosinski.com/) and [Cooper
Bills](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/cooper-bills/17/363/a51) for
[Cornell's Introduction to Computer Vision (CS4670)](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4670/2010fa/)
(Fall 2010).



Project Synopsis
=================

This project uses OpenCV running on a Nokia N900 to detect faces using
the built-in camera. Then, from a database of the user's Facebook
friends (and friends of friends), we match the faces seen by the phone
to images of people from Facebook, and overlay their name. Other
information could easily be added.

The idea was that one could bring this app to a party and, upon seeing
someone across the room, quickly bring up their name and basic info.



Results
=================

Below is a screenshot from our in-class demo, showing two successful
labels:

\section{Progress}

Our tasks and our progress on each are shown below.

\newcommand{\prog}[1]{\textit{\\
#1}}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Set up a server for collaboration and running required
  server-side code.  \prog{Done. We set up a server and are using Trac
    and Git for
    collaboration\footnote{\code{http://cs4670.yosinski.com/}}.  We're
    currently running the vision code locally, but will transition
    parts of it to the server as the need arises.}
\item Code and demonstrate basic face detection.  \prog{Done.  We have
  implemented basic face detection using a Haar wavelet detector from
  OpenCV; see Results section.}
\item Code and demonstrate basic facial feature description.
  \prog{Investigated, coding not started.}

\section{Results}

Some results using our Haar wavelet detector are shown in
\figref{small_face.jpg} through \figref{three_faces.jpg}.

\figvarp{small_face.jpg}{.60}{Haar wavelet detection of a face taking up
  a small fraction of the image.}{}

\figvarp{small_face_sideways.jpg}{.60}{Our Haar wavelet detector tends
  not to work if the faces are rotated more than 30 degrees.}{}

\figvarp{three_faces.jpg}{.60}{Detection of multiple faces at different
  scales in a single image works well.}{}

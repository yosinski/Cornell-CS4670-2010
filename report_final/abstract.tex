We created a mobile based system for detecting faces within a
picture and matching these faces to a precompiled database.
Face detection is done using a Haar cascade, and
face recognization is done using a combination of Fisherfaces
and PCA analysis (Eigenfaces).


%matching these faces to a user's friends (and possibly
%friends of friends) on Facebook, and outputting the retrieved user's
%information from Facebook and/or Twitter.

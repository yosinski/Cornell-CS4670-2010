We created a mobile based system for detecting faces within a picture
and matching these faces to a precompiled database.  Face detection is
done using a Haar cascade, and face recognization is done using a
combination of Fisherfaces and PCA analysis, also known as Eigenfaces.
The system shows promising performance and processes images quickly
even on a mobile platform.

%matching these faces to a user's friends (and possibly
%friends of friends) on Facebook, and outputting the retrieved user's
%information from Facebook and/or Twitter.

\section{Introduction} % short intro

\edit{Cooper}

Our original proposal was to create a mobile application that will
identify people in an photo using pictures from facebook, and then
poll their information and status and display it in the photo.  This
was to create an augmented reality interface on the mobile device.
However, we quickly found that to create a quality application with
this ability would require more time and resources than we had.

As an alternative, we created a simpler application that utilized a
local database with the goal to find and identify faces in an mobile
image.  This database is created on a desktop computer and copied to
the phone before the application is used.  Our testing utilized two
databases: The Yale Face Database\footnote{Available here:
  http://cvc.yale.edu/projects/yalefaces/yalefaces.html}\cite{YaleFace}
and our own custom database from facebook images.

Some results using our Haar wavelet detector are shown in
\figref{small_face.jpg} through \figref{three_faces.jpg}.

  a small fraction of the image.}{}

\figvarp{small_face_sideways.jpg}{.60}{Our Haar wavelet detector tends
  not to work if the faces are rotated more than 30 degrees.}{}

  scales in a single image works well.}{}

Equations from wikipedia:

\begin{equation}
S=\frac{\sigma_{between}^2}{\sigma_{within}^2}= \frac{(\vec w \cdot \vec \mu_{y=1} - \vec w \cdot \vec \mu_{y=0})^2}{\vec w^T \Sigma_{y=1} \vec w + \vec w^T \Sigma_{y=0} \vec w} = \frac{(\vec w \cdot (\vec \mu_{y=1} - \vec \mu_{y=0}))^2}{\vec w^T (\Sigma_{y=0}+\Sigma_{y=1}) \vec w}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\vec w = (\Sigma_{y=0}+\Sigma_{y=1})^{-1}(\vec \mu_{y=1} - \vec \mu_{y=0})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\vec w = (\Sigma_{y=0} + \Sigma_{y=1} + \epsilon I)^{-1}(\vec \mu_{y=1} - \vec \mu_{y=0})
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
s_{ratio} = \frac{s_{test} - s_{\mu_0}}{s_{\mu_1} - s_{\mu_0}}
\end{equation}
